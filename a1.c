//We need to justify each line. Run method to justify text outside of main method ? 

//If a word in the text file is longer than the width of the lines, return error only saying that "Error. The word processor canâ€™t display the output."

//Entry to the program 
int main(int argc, charargv[]) {

    //Ensure correct command line arguments are input 
    if (argc != 3) {
         printf("Usage: %s <line_length> <input_file.txt>\n", argv[0]);

    // Step 1(?): Read in the text file, determine how many characters are in it. Input file is a string, which is a null terminated 1D array of char characters. 
            //a. Read in the char characters from the text file into a string variable. 

    // Example: 
        // input.txt contains: I love doing c code. 
            // Read this into string variable: char string =         

    //Step 2(?)  From here we can divide the number of characters by the line length that was input, to determine how many characters can fit per row.



    // Probably want to malloc the string becasue we will most likely want to use the array outside of a function call 

    //I think we need to create a 2D array with the given inputs. Line width represents the columns, and the input text length can represent the rows

    //command line argument "line width", so array columns are known right away, but not the rows 

    // Name of the input file 
    char *inputFileName = argv[1];

    // The length of each line (Techincally the ammount of columns in the array)
    int lineWidth = atoi(argv[2]);
    
    // Point to position in memory ? At this point in the program, size is not known. 
    char *arr;

    // 2D matrix
    char **matrix;

    //Read in the input file 
    FILE *file = fopen(inputFileName, "r");
        if (file == NULL) {
            printf("Failed to open input file.\n");
            return 1; 
    }

    //Move pointer to the end
    fseek(file, 0, SEEK_END);

    //File size can be determined as ftell returns how the size in bytes from the beginning to the end of the file 
    long file_size = ftell(file);

    //Move pointer to start so we can iterate through the text file
    fseek(file, 0, SEEK_START);

    // Allocate memory for the input txt file 
    arr = (char *) malloc(file_size * sizeof(char *));

    printf("%p", arr);

    // Allocate memory for 2D array 
    //char **matrix = (char **) malloc( * sizeof(char *));
