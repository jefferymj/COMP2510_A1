//We need to justify each line. Run method to justify text outside of main method ? 

//If a word in the text file is longer than the width of the lines, return error only saying that "Error. The word processor canâ€™t display the output."

//Entry to the program

    // Step 1(?): Read in the text file, determine how many characters are in it. Input file is a string, which is a null terminated 1D array of char characters. 
            //a. Read in the char characters from the text file into a string variable. 

    // Example: 
        // input.txt contains: I love doing c code. 
            // Read this into string variable: char string =         

    //Step 2(?)  From here we can divide the number of characters by the line length that was input, to determine how many characters can fit per row.



    // Probably want to malloc the string becasue we will most likely want to use the array outside of a function call 

    //I think we need to create a 2D array with the given inputs. Line width represents the columns, and the input text length can represent the rows

    //command line argument "line width", so array columns are known right away, but not the rows 

    // Name of the input file 
    char *inputFileName = argv[1];

    // The length of each line (Techincally the ammount of columns in the array)
    int lineWidth = atoi(argv[2]);

    //Read in the input file
